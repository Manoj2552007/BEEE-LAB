## THEORY

### Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL)
Kirchhoff's voltage law states that the sum of the voltage differences around any closed loop in a circuit must be zero. A loop in a circuit is any path that ends at the same point at which it starts.  

### Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL)
Kirchhoff's Current Law states that the algebraic sum of the currents entering and leaving a node is equal to zero. Currents entering the node are considered positive, and those leaving a node are negative.

## PROCEDURE

### a. KVL
1. Connect the circuit as per the circuit diagram.  
2. Set the RPS voltage to zero.  
3. Check all meters for null position.  
4. Switch on the RPS.  
5. Set the input voltage to a value between 0V to 30V.  
6. Record the voltage across each resistor using the voltmeter.  
7. Repeat for different input voltages and tabulate the results.  

### b. KCL
1. Connect the circuit as per the circuit diagram.  
2. Set the RPS voltage to zero.  
3. Check all meters for null position.  
4. Switch on the RPS.  
5. Set the input voltage to a value between 0V to 30V.  
6. Record the current through each resistor using the ammeter.  
7. Repeat for different input voltages and tabulate the results.
